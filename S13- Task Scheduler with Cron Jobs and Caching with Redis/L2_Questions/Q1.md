# **L2: Event Management System with Role-Based Access and Redis Caching**  

### **Objective:**  
Develop an **Event Management System** with **role-based access control (RBAC)** and **Redis caching**.  

---  

## **Problem Statement**  

Build an application with **User** and **Admin** roles.  

### **1. Authentication & Roles**  
- Users can **sign up** and **log in**.  
- Assign roles: **"user"** or **"admin"**.  
- **JWT authentication** must be implemented.  

### **2. Event Management**  
- Users can **Create, Read, Update, and Delete** their own events.  
- Admins can **CRUD all events**.  
- Events should have:  
  - **Title**  
  - **Description**  
  - **Event Date**  
  - **Created By**  

### **3. Redis Caching for Events**  
- **GET requests** for events should first **check Redis** before querying the database.  
- When an event is **deleted within 24 hours of its start time**, it should be **stored in Redis instead of being removed**.  

### **4. Cron Job for Expired Event Cleanup**  
- A **cron job** should run **every 5 minutes**.  
- It should **delete expired events from Redis**.  

---  

## **Expected Outcomes**  
- Users and admins should have **role-based access**.  
- Redis should **cache events** and handle **soft deletion**.  
- The cron job should **remove expired events from Redis every 5 minutes**.  

---  

## **Submission Guidelines**  
- Implement **RBAC, Redis caching, and cron jobs**.  
- Submit a **README** with setup instructions.
