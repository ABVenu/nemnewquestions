# **L1: Todo System with Redis Caching and Cron Jobs**  

### **Objective:**  
Build a **Todo system** with authentication, Redis caching, and a cron job for pending task logging.  

---  

## **Problem Statement**  

Develop an application that allows users to **sign up, log in, and manage todos** with the following functionalities:  

### **1. User Authentication (Signup & Login)**  
- Users can **sign up** with **email and password**.  
- Implement **secure password hashing**.  
- Generate a **JWT token** upon successful login.  

### **2. Todo CRUD Operations**  
- Users can **Create, Read, Update, and Delete** their todos.  
- Each todo should have:  
  - **Title**  
  - **Description**  
  - **Status** (Pending/Completed)  

### **3. Redis Caching for Todos**  
- The first **GET request** for todos should fetch data from the **database**.  
- The second time, data should be **served from Redis**.  
- The cache should **expire in 3 minutes**.  

### **4. Cron Job for Logging Pending Todos**  
- A **cron job** should run **every 2 minutes**.  
- It should **fetch pending todos** and log them.  

---  

## **Expected Outcomes**  
- Users can **sign up, log in, and manage their todos**.  
- Redis caching should **improve efficiency**.  
- The cron job should **log pending todos every 2 minutes**.  

---  

## **Submission Guidelines**  
- Implement **JWT authentication, Redis caching, and a cron job**.  
- Provide a **README** with setup instructions.
