# **L0: Implementing Redis for Key-Value Storage**  

### **Objective:**  
Set up and use **Redis** to store and retrieve key-value pairs.  

---  

## **Problem Statement**  

You need to install and configure **Redis** and write a script that:  

### **Task Details:**  
- **Stores a key-value pair** (e.g., `"name": "John Doe"`) in Redis.  
- **Retrieves the stored value** and prints it to the console.  
- **Deletes the key** from Redis after retrieval.  

---  

## **Expected Outcomes**  
- Successful storage and retrieval of a value using Redis.  
- Proper deletion of the key after retrieval.  

---  

## **Submission Guidelines**  
- Submit the script that **stores, retrieves, and deletes the key**.  
- Include a brief **README** on how to run the script.
