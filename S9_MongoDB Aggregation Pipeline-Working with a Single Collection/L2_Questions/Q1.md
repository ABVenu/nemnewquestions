# **L2: Fitness Tracking Analytics API**  

### **Objective:**  
Build an API to track **user workout trends, calories burned, and workout patterns** using MongoDB aggregations on a **single `workouts` collection**.  

---

### **Schema Details:**  

#### **`workouts` Collection**  
```js
const workoutSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  username: String,
  workoutType: String, // "Cardio", "Strength", "Yoga", etc.
  duration: Number, // in minutes
  caloriesBurned: Number,
  workoutDate: Date,
  intensity: String, // "Low", "Medium", "High"
});
```

### **Routes & Queries:**  

#### **Data Insertion Route**  
- **POST `/workouts`** → Add a new workout record  

#### **Aggregation Routes**
