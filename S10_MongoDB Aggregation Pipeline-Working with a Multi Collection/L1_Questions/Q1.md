# **L1: Library Management System API**  

### **Objective:**

```js
const bookSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: String,
  author: String,
  genre: String,
  publishedYear: Number
});
```

#### **`borrowers` Collection**  
```js
const borrowerSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  email: String,
  membershipDate: Date
});
```

#### **`loans` Collection**  
```js
const loanSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  bookId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Book" },
  borrowerId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Borrower" },
  loanDate: Date,
  returnDate: Date,
