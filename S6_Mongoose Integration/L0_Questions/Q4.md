### **Inventory Management System with MongoDB Integration using Mongoose**

### **Total Objective**  
Build an Inventory Management System using MongoDB and Mongoose. Implement models for managing products and inventory-related operations.

### **L0: Basic Mongoose Setup and Product Model Creation**

1. **Install and Configure Mongoose**:  
   - Install Mongoose and configure it to connect to the MongoDB database `InventoryDB`.  
   - Handle successful connections and error scenarios.  

2. **Define Mongoose Product Model**:

     - `category` (string)  
     - `quantity` (number)  
     - `price` (number)  
     - `supplier` (string)  
    

3. **Mongoose CRUD Operations for Products**:  
   - **Create**: Add a new product to the inventory.  
   - **Read**: Retrieve all products or filter products by `category` or `quantity`.  
   - **Update**: Modify product details such as `quantity`, `price`, or `supplier`.  
   - **Delete**: Remove a product by its ID.
