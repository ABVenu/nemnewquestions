# **Event Management System with MongoDB Integration using Mongoose**

### **Total Objective**  
Create an Event Management System that uses MongoDB for data storage and Mongoose for schema definition and CRUD operations.

### **L0: Basic Mongoose Setup and Event Model Creation**

1. **Install and Configure Mongoose**:  
   - Install Mongoose and configure it to connect to the `EventDB` MongoDB database.  
   - Ensure the connection is successful and handle errors gracefully.

2. **Define Mongoose Event Model**:  
   - Create an `Event` schema with the following fields:  
     - `title` (string, required)  
     - `description` (string, optional)  
     - `location` (string, optional)  
     - `date` (Date, required)  
     - `attendees` (an array of user IDs)  

3. **Mongoose CRUD Operations for Events**:  
   - **Create**: Add a new event to the database.  
   - **Read**: Retrieve all events or filter events by date or location.  
   - **Update**: Modify event details such as `date`, `title`, and `attendees`.  
   - **Delete**: Remove an event by its ID.
