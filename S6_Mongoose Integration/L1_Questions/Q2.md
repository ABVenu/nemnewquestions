### **L1:Event Management System**

---

### **Total Objective**

Develop an advanced Event Management System with logical CRUD operations and middleware-based validation. Ensure proper project structure and implement logic to handle event capacity, status, and automatic updates.

---

1. **Setup Folder Structure**  
   Maintain the following folder structure:
   ```
   project-root/
   ├── models/           # Mongoose models
   │   └── event.model.js
   ├── routes/           # Express routes
   │   └── event.routes.js
   ├── config/           # Configuration files
   │   └── db.js         # MongoDB connection logic
   ├── controllers/      # Controller logic
   │   └── event.controller.js
   ├── middleware/       # Middleware logic
   │   └── event.middleware.js  # Validation middleware
   ├── .env              # Environment variables
   ├── app.js            # Application entry point
   └── package.json
   ```

---

### **Event Model**

Define an `Event` schema with the following fields:

- `title` (string)
- `description` (string)
- `date` (date)
- `maxCapacity` (number)
- `eventCapacity` (number)
- `isFull` (boolean)

---

### **Middleware Validation (event.middleware.js)**

Implement middleware to handle the following validations:

1. **Data Validation Middleware**: `title`, `description`, `date` should be sent through `req.body`, if anyone field is missing, the middleware should send response as `Incomplete Data Received`
2. **Event Full Check**: Automatically set `isFull` to `true` if `capacity` is reached.

---

### **Advanced CRUD Operations**

1. **Create an Event (POST /events)**:
   - only `title`, `description`, `date` should be sent through `req.body`
   - Ensure the event `title` is unique.
   - `eventCapacity` should be `0`, `maxCapacity` should be `300`, `isFull` should `false` these should be happen by backend logic
   - **Data Validation Middleware** should be applied
2. **Retrieve Events (GET /events)**:
   - Get all the events
   - Allow optional filtering by `title` through query.
3. **Update Event Details (PATCH /events/:id)**:
   - Any general updation like `title`, `description`.
   - `date` and `maxCapacity` should no be updated at any cost
4. **Update Capacity (PATCH /events/update/:id)**:
   - Ensure `eventCapacity` does not exceed the `maxCapacity`, in case send a response as `MaxCapacity Reached`
   - **Event Full Check** middleware should be applied here.
5. **Delete Events (DELETE /events/:id)**:
   - Allow deletion of events if date is not passed

### **Submission Instructions**

- Submit Masai repository link.
- Ensure all files and folders follow the specified structure.
- Use `.env` for sensitive credentials.
- Ensure validation middleware is properly integrated before CRUD operations.
