# Assignment: Text Appender API using Express

**Total Objective**: Develop an Express server application that appends text data received from requests to a file and provides a confirmation response.

---

## **L0 Assignment: Text Appending and Response**

**Objective**: Implement basic server functionality that accepts text input and appends it to a file using Node.js and Express.

---

**Tasks**:

1. **Package Initialization**:  
   - **Setup Project**: Initialize a new Node.js project using `npm init -y` to generate a `package.json` file.  
   - **Install Dependencies**: Install Express by running `npm i express`.

---

2. **Basic Server Setup**:  
   - **Create Express Server**:
     - Import the Express module and create an Express application.
     - Set the server to listen on port 3000.
     - Add a console log to indicate that the server is running (e.g., `"Server is running on port 3000"`).

---

3. **Route Creation**:  
   - **Text Appending Route (`/data`)**:  
     - Implement a POST route (`/data`) that accepts text data from the request body (in plain text format).
     - Append the text to a file named `data.txt`.  
     - If the text is successfully added, respond with `"Thanks for adding text!"`.  

---

4. **Data Persistence**:  
   - Ensure the `data.txt` file is created if it doesnâ€™t exist.
   - Append new text to the file without overwriting the existing content.

---

5. **Error Handling**:  
   - Handle any potential errors (e.g., file writing errors) and respond with `"An error occurred while adding text"` if something goes wrong.

---

**Expected Outcomes**:  

- A functioning Express server that accepts text data at the `/data` route, appends it to a file named `data.txt`, and responds with `"Thanks for adding text!"`.  
- Proper error handling for any file-related issues.
