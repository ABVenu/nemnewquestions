# Assignment: File Reader API using Express

**Total Objective**: Develop an Express server application with predefined routes for reading specific files. Handle undefined routes with appropriate error messages.

## **L0 Assignment: File Reading via Direct Routes**

**Objective**: Implement basic server functionality to read the contents of predefined files and handle undefined routes.

---

**Tasks**:

1. **Package Initialization**:  
   - **Setup Project**: Initialize a new Node.js project using `npm init -y` to generate a `package.json` file.  
   - **Install Dependencies**: Install Express by running `npm i express`.

---

2. **Basic Server Setup**:  
   - **Create Express Server**:
     - Import the Express module and create an Express application.
     - Set the server to listen on port 3000.
     - Add a console log to indicate that the server is running (e.g., `"Server is running on port 3000"`).

---

3. **File Reading Routes**:  
   - **Route 1: `/read/index.js`**:  
     - Read the file named `index.js` from the project directory and return its contents as the response.  

   - **Route 2: `/read/data.txt`**:  
     - Read the file named `data.txt` from the project directory and return its contents as the response.

---

4. **Error Handling for Undefined Routes**:  
   - For any other routes (e.g., `/read/other.txt` or `/undefined`), respond with `"File not found"`.

---

5. **Optional Tasks (for Further Practice)**:  
   - Add a route `/read/app.js` to read a file named `app.js`.  
   - Improve error handling by returning more details (e.g., `"The file index.js does not exist"`).

---

**Expected Outcomes**:  

- A functioning Express server with direct routes for reading specific files (`/read/index.js` and `/read/data.txt`).  
- Proper error handling for undefined routes, with meaningful error messages like `"File not found"`.
