# Assignment: Simple Express Server with Basic Routing

**Total Objective**: Develop a basic Express server application with multiple routes and error handling. The application should handle requests for different pages and provide appropriate responses.

## **L0 Assignment: Basic Routing and Error Handling**

**Objective**: Implement foundational server features with simple routing and error handling.

---

**Tasks**:

1. **Package Initialization**:  
   - **Setup Project**: Initialize a new Node.js project using `npm init -y` to generate a `package.json` file.  
   - **Install Dependencies**: Install Express by running `npm i express`.

---

2. **Basic Server Setup**:  
   - **Create Express Server**:
     - Import the Express module and create an Express application.
     - Set the server to listen on port 3000.
     - Add a console log to indicate that the server is running (e.g., `"Server is running on port 3000"`).

---

3. **Route Creation**:  
   - **Home Route (`/home`)**:  
     - Respond with `"Welcome to the Home Page!"` when the `/home` route is accessed.
   - **Contact Us Route (`/contactus`)**:  
     - Respond with `"Welcome to the Contact Us Page!"` when the `/contactus` route is accessed.
   - **About Us Route (`/aboutus`)**:  
     - Respond with `"Welcome to the About Us Page!"` when the `/aboutus` route is accessed.

---

4. **Error Handling**:  
   - **404 Error Handling**:  
     - Implement a catch-all route to handle any undefined routes.
     - Respond with `"404 Not Found: The page you are looking for does not exist"` for all non-existent routes.

---

**Expected Outcomes**:  

- A functioning Express server that responds appropriately to the `/home`, `/contactus`, and `/aboutus` routes.
- Proper 404 error handling for undefined routes.
