# Assignment: Learning Management System Application

**Total Objective**: Develop a simple Learning Management System (LMS) application using Node.js, Express, and JSON file storage for data persistence. The application should allow users to create, read, update, and delete courses.

---

## **L1 Assignment: Basic Features Implementation**

**Objective**: Implement the foundational features of the LMS application.

**Tasks**:

1. **Package Initialization**:
   - **Setup Project**: Initialize a new Node.js project using `npm init -y` to create a `package.json` file.
   - **Install Dependencies**: Install Express by running `npm i express`.

2. **Basic Server Setup**:
   - **Create Express Server**:
     - Import Express and create an Express application.
     - Set up the server to listen on a specific port (e.g., 3000) and include a console log to confirm the server is running.

3. **Course Data Storage**:
   - **Create `db.json`**: Create a JSON file named `db.json` to act as the database for storing course information.
   - **Initial Structure**: Prepopulate the JSON file with an empty array for courses.

4. **Basic CRUD Operations**:
   - **Create Course**:
     - Implement a POST route (`/courses`) that accepts course data (title, description, etc.) and saves it to `db.json`.
     - Respond with a message confirming the course has been added.
   - **Read Courses**:
     - Implement a GET route (`/courses`) to retrieve and display all courses from `db.json`.

**Expected Outcomes**:

- A functioning LMS application with a basic server, course storage, and the ability to create and read courses.
