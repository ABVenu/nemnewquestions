# Assignment: Learning Management System Application

## **L1 Assignment: Intermediate Features Enhancement**

**Objective**: Enhance the LMS application with more complex features.

**Tasks**:

1. **Update Course**:
   - **Implement PUT Route**: Create a PUT route (`/courses/:id`) to update an existing course's details based on its ID.
   - **Input Requirement**: Accept the course ID and updated data in the request body.
   - **Output**: Respond with a message confirming the course has been updated.

2. **Delete Course**:
   - **Implement DELETE Route**: Create a DELETE route (`/courses/:id`) that allows users to remove a course by its ID.
   - **Output**: Respond with a message confirming the course has been deleted.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - **Implement Basic Error Handling**: Ensure that appropriate error messages are returned for invalid requests (e.g., trying to update or delete a non-existing course).
   - **HTTP Status Codes**: Use relevant HTTP status codes (e.g., 404 for not found, 200 for success).

4. **API Testing**:
   - **Use Postman/Insomnia**: Test all API endpoints using an API testing tool like Postman or Insomnia. Document the results of the tests.

**Expected Outcomes**:

- An enhanced LMS application that supports updating and deleting courses, with robust error handling and API testing.
