# Assignment: User Management API using Express

**Total Objective**: Create an Express server that manages user data through CRUD operations, stores user information in `db.json`, and implements additional features like password hashing.

---

## **L0 Assignment: Basic User Management System**

**Objective**: Implement routes to perform CRUD operations on user data, ensuring secure handling of sensitive information.

---

### **Tasks**:

1. **Package Initialization**:  
   - **Setup Project**: Initialize a new Node.js project using `npm init -y`.  
   - **Install Dependencies**: Install Express by running `npm i express`.  

---

2. **Basic Server Setup**:  
   - **Create Express Server**:
     - Import Express and create an Express application.
     - Set the server to listen on port 3000.
     - Add a console log to indicate the server is running.

---

3. **User Data Storage**:  
   - **Create `db.json`**: Store user information (name, email, hashed password, id).  
   - **Create `deletedusers.json`**: Store deleted user information when a user is deleted.

---

4. **CRUD Routes**:  

   - **Add User (`/adduser`)**:
     - Accept user data (name, email, password) from the request body.
     - Store the user in `db.json`, assigning a unique `id`.
     - Respond with `"User Added"`.

   - **Get All Users (`/getusers`)**:
     - Retrieve all users from `db.json`, excluding passwords.
     - Send the list of users in the response.

   - **Get Specific User (`/user/:id`)**:
     - Retrieve the user by `id` from `db.json`, excluding the password.
     - Respond with the user details or `"User not found"` if the user does not exist.

   - **Update User (`/updateuser/:id`)**:
     - Update the user's information (name and password onlyâ€”**email cannot be updated**).
     - Respond with `"User Updated"` or `"User not found"` if the user does not exist.

   - **Delete User (`/deleteuser/:id`)**:
     - Remove the user from `db.json` and store the deleted user in `deletedusers.json`.
     - Respond with `"User Deleted"` or `"User not found"` if the user does not exist.

---

5. **Optional Advanced Feature**:

   - **Hash Passwords**:
     - Use Node.js's `crypto` module to hash passwords before storing them in `db.json`.
     - Ensure that hashed passwords are returned instead of plain text.

---

### **Expected Outcomes**:  

- A fully functional Express server with CRUD routes to manage users.  
- Proper responses for successful operations and error handling for missing users.  
- Secure handling of passwords using hashing with the `crypto` module.
