Here are five multiple-choice questions based on the notes:

### **1. Why is password hashing important in authentication systems?**  
A) It makes passwords shorter for easy storage  
B) It ensures passwords are stored securely and prevents direct access  
C) It encrypts passwords, allowing them to be decrypted later  
D) It replaces passwords with a PIN for security  

**Answer:** B) It ensures passwords are stored securely and prevents direct access

### **2. What is the purpose of "salt rounds" in bcrypt hashing?**  
A) To store the password in plaintext  
B) To add randomness to hashes, making them harder to crack  
C) To reduce the size of hashed passwords  
D) To make the hashing process faster  

**Answer:** B) To add randomness to hashes, making them harder to crack

### **3. How does Role-Based Authentication (RBAC) enhance security?**  
A) It allows users to create new roles dynamically  
B) It restricts access to certain routes based on assigned roles  
C) It automatically grants admin privileges to all users  
D) It stores user credentials in plaintext  

**Answer:** B) It restricts access to certain routes based on assigned roles

### **4. Why is token blacklisting used in authentication systems?**  
A) To prevent expired tokens from being used  
B) To allow users to share tokens securely  
C) To speed up authentication by reusing tokens  
D) To replace JWT with session-based authentication  

**Answer:** A) To prevent expired tokens from being used

### **5. What is the best practice to store JWT refresh tokens securely?**  
A) Store them in local storage  
B) Store them in HTTP-only cookies  
C) Store them in the URL parameters  
D) Store them in plaintext in the database  

**Answer:** B) Store them in HTTP-only cookies
