# **L0: One-to-Many Relationships in Mongoose**

### **Total Objective**

Create basic Mongoose schemas for a One-to-Many relational structure. Insert data into both collections and establish the relationship properly to understand One-to-Many relationships in Mongoose.

---

### **Problem Statement**

Implement a **Category-Product relationship** where:

- One category can have multiple products.
- Each product is assigned to a category.
- This relationship is common in e-commerce applications to group products under various categories.

---

## **Schema Design**

### **Category Schema**

- `name`: String, required, minimum length of 3 characters
- `description`: String, optional

### **Product Schema**

- `name`: String, required, minimum length of 3 characters
- `price`: Number, required
- `category`: ObjectId, required (reference to the `Category` collection)

---

### **Routes**

1. **Add Category** (`POST /add-category`):

   - Add a new category with `name` and `description` fields.

2. **Add Product** (`POST /add-product`):
   - Add a new product with `name`, `price`, and `category`. Ensure the `category` reference is valid.

---

## **Instructions**

1. **Schema Creation**:

   - Create two schemas (Category and Product).
   - Establish the One-to-Many relationship using an `ObjectId` reference in the `Product` schema.

2. **Insert Data**:

   - Insert sample categories and products to verify the relationship.

3. **Relationship Verification**:
   - Retrieve all products along with their respective category names using `.populate()`.

## **Example Task Data**

1. **Category**:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "Electronics",
     "description": "Electronic gadgets and devices"
   }
   ```

2. **Product**:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "Smartphone",
     "price": 50000,
     "category": "ObjectId_of_category"
   }
   ```

---

## **Good Practices**

- Ensure unique category names for better data organization.
- Validate all required fields before data insertion.
- Structure files properly with separate folders for models and routes.

## **Submission**

- Push your code to your Masai GitHub repo and share the link.
