# **L0: Many-to-Many Relationships in Mongoose**

### **Total Objective**

Create Mongoose schemas for a Many-to-Many relationship. Insert data and ensure relationships are established properly. This task will help students understand and implement Many-to-Many relationships in Mongoose.

---

### **Problem Statement**

Implement a **Student-Course relationship** where:

- One student can enroll in multiple courses.
- One course can have multiple enrolled students.
- This relationship is commonly used in learning management systems (LMS).

---

## **Schema Design**

### **Student Schema**

- `name`: String, required, minimum length of 3 characters
- `email`: String, required, unique
- `enrolledCourses`: Array of ObjectIds (references to the `Course` collection)

### **Course Schema**

- `name`: String, required, minimum length of 3 characters
- `description`: String, optional
- `enrolledStudents`: Array of ObjectIds (references to the `Student` collection)

---

### **Routes**

1. **Add Student** (`POST /add-student`):

   - Add a new student with `name`, `email`, and optionally `enrolledCourses`.

2. **Add Course** (`POST /add-course`):

   - Add a new course with `name` and `description`. Optionally, include `enrolledStudents`.

3. **Enroll Student** (`POST /enroll-student`):
   - Enroll a student in a course by updating both the `Student` and `Course` collections to reflect the relationship.

---

## **Instructions**

1. **Schema Creation**:

   - Create two schemas (Student and Course) and establish the Many-to-Many relationship using arrays of `ObjectIds`.

2. **Insert Data**:

   - Insert sample students and courses, and create enrollments to test the relationship.

3. **Relationship Verification**:
   - Retrieve all courses a student is enrolled in and all students enrolled in a course using `.populate()`.

## **Example Task Data**

1. **Student**:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "Alice Johnson",
     "email": "alice@example.com",
     "enrolledCourses": ["ObjectId_of_course_1", "ObjectId_of_course_2"]
   }
   ```

2. **Course**:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "Web Development",
     "description": "Learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript",
     "enrolledStudents": ["ObjectId_of_student_1", "ObjectId_of_student_2"]
   }
   ```

---

## **Good Practices**

- Ensure unique student emails and course names.
- Avoid circular references or redundant data entries.
- Use proper validation and error handling for all insertions and updates.
