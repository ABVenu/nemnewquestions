# **L0: One to Many Relationships in Mongoose**

### **Total Objective**

Create basic Mongoose schemas for a simple relational structure and insert data into the collections. No advanced query or operations are required at this stage. This task will help students understand how to design schemas and establish basic relationships between collections.

---

### **Problem Statement**

Implement a basic **User-Post relationship** where:

- One user can create multiple posts.
- Each post references the user who created it.
- The goal is to establish a One-to-Many relationship between users and posts, which is common in blogging or social media platforms.

---

## **Schema Design**

### **User Schema**

- `name`: String, required, minimum length of 3 characters
- `email`: String, required, unique
- `age`: Number, optional

### **Post Schema**

- `title`: String, required, minimum length of 3 characters
- `content`: String, required
- `author`: ObjectId, required (reference to the `User` collection)
- `createdAt`: Date, default to the current date

---

### **Routes**

1. **Add User** (`POST /add-user`):

   - Add a new user with `name`, `email`, and `age` fields.

2. **Add Post** (`POST /add-post`):
   - Add a new post with `title`, `content`, and `author`. Ensure `author` is a valid reference to an existing user.

---

## **Instructions**

1. **Schema Creation**:

   - Create two separate schemas (User and Post).
   - Ensure relationships are defined properly using `ObjectId` for references.

2. **Insert Data**:

   - Insert a few users and posts manually to test the relationship.

3. **Relationship Verification**:
   - Print all posts, including the authorâ€™s name (use `.populate()` in Mongoose to fetch the related user).

## **Example Task Data**

1. **User**:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "John Doe",
     "email": "john@example.com",
     "age": 25
   }
   ```

2. **Post**:
   ```json
   {
     "title": "Understanding Mongoose Relationships",
     "content": "Mongoose makes working with MongoDB relationships easier.",
     "author": "ObjectId_of_user"
   }
   ```

---

## **Good Practices**

- Ensure required fields are validated before insertion.
- Use meaningful error messages for missing or invalid data.
- Organize code into folders (e.g., `models/` and `routes/`).

## **Submission**

- Push your code to your GitHub repo and share the link.
