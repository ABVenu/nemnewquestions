# **L1: Student Course Enrollment System**  

### **Total Objective**  
Create a **Student Course Enrollment System** using Mongoose with two schemas: `Student` and `Course`. Implement CRUD operations for both schemas and use the `.populate()` method to retrieve and display related information about students and their enrolled courses.  

---

### **Problem Statement**  
Develop a system where:  
- A **Student** can enroll in multiple **Courses**.  
- Each **Course** can have multiple enrolled **Students**.  
- Perform CRUD operations on both `Student` and `Course` collections and use `.populate()` to retrieve relationships.  

---

## **Schema Design**  

### **Student Schema**  
- `name`: String, required, minimum length of 3 characters  
- `email`: String, required, unique  
- `enrolledCourses`: Array of ObjectIds (references to the `Course` collection)  

### **Course Schema**  
- `title`: String, required, minimum length of 3 characters  
- `description`: String, optional  
- `instructor`: String, required  
- `studentsEnrolled`: Array of ObjectIds (references to the `Student` collection)  

---

## **Routes**  

1. **Add Student** (`POST /add-student`):  
   - Add a new student with `name` and `email`.  

2. **Add Course** (`POST /add-course`):  
   - Add a new course with `title`, `description`, and `instructor`.  

3. **Enroll Student in Course** (`POST /enroll-student`):  
   - Enroll a student in a course, updating both `Student.enrolledCourses` and `Course.studentsEnrolled`.  

4. **Unenroll Student from Course** (`POST /unenroll-student`):  
   - Unenroll a student from a course, removing references from both collections.  

5. **Get Student Courses** (`GET /student-courses/:studentId`):  
   - Retrieve all courses a student is enrolled in using `.populate()`.  

6. **Get Course Enrollments** (`GET /course-enrollments/:courseId`):  
   - Retrieve all students enrolled in a specific course using `.populate()`.  

7. **Update Course** (`PUT /update-course/:courseId`):  
   - Update course details like `title`, `description`, or `instructor`.  

8. **Delete Course** (`DELETE /delete-course/:courseId`):  
   - Delete a course and remove it from all studentsâ€™ `enrolledCourses` arrays.  

---

## **Instructions**  

1. **Schema Creation**:  
   - Define `Student` and `Course` schemas with `ObjectId` references to establish relationships.  

2. **Data Population**:  
   - Use `.populate()` for retrieving related information about students and courses.  

3. **CRUD Operations**:  
   - Ensure comprehensive CRUD operations for both schemas, with proper handling of enrollment and unenrollment.

## **Example Task Data**  

1. **Student**:  
   ```json  
   {  
     "name": "John Doe",  
     "email": "john@example.com"  
   }  
   ```  

2. **Course**:  
   ```json  
   {  
     "title": "Introduction to Web Development",  
     "description": "A beginner-friendly course on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript",  
     "instructor": "Jane Smith"  
   }  
   ```  

---

## **Good Practices**  
- Ensure unique student emails and proper validation for all fields.  
- Implement meaningful error messages and appropriate status codes for all endpoints.  
- Maintain a modular project structure (`models/`, `routes/`, `controllers/`).
