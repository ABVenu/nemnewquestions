# Terminal-Based Task Management Application Assignments

## **L1 Assignment: Basic Features Implementation**

**Objective**: Implement the core features of a terminal-based task management application.

**Tasks**:

1. **Task Creation**:
   - **Implement a Command**: Create a command (`add-task`) that accepts user input for the task title and due date.
   - **Validation**: Ensure that the task title and due date cannot be empty.
   - **Output**: Confirm task creation with a message indicating the task has been added.

2. **Task Listing**:
   - **Implement a Command**: Create a command (`list-tasks`) that retrieves and displays all tasks in a structured format.
   - **Display Format**: Each task should include the task title, due date, and status (pending/completed).

3. **Task Completion**:
   - **Implement a Command**: Create a command (`complete-task`) that allows users to mark a task as completed.
   - **Input Requirement**: The command should accept the task ID or title to identify which task to complete.
   - **Output**: Confirm the task's status has been updated to completed.

4. **Basic User Interface**:
   - **CLI Structure**: Implement a simple command-line interface that:
     - Displays a welcome message.
     - Prompts users for input commands.

**Expected Outcomes**:

- A functioning terminal application that allows users to create, list, and complete tasks with proper validation and feedback.
