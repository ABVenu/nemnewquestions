# Terminal-Based Task Management Application Assignments

## **L1 Assignment: Intermediate Features Enhancement**

**Objective**: Enhance the terminal-based task management application by adding more complex features.

**Tasks**:

1. **Task Update**:
   - **Implement a Command**: Create a command (`update-task`) that allows users to change the title or due date of an existing task.
   - **Input Requirement**: The command should accept the task ID or title and the new title or due date.
   - **Output**: Confirm the task has been updated successfully.

2. **Task Deletion**:
   - **Implement a Command**: Create a command (`delete-task`) that allows users to remove a task from the list.
   - **Input Requirement**: The command should accept the task ID or title to identify which task to delete.
   - **Output**: Confirm that the task has been deleted.

3. **Search Functionality**:
   - **Implement a Command**: Create a command (`search-tasks`) that allows users to search tasks by title or due date.
   - **Output**: Display all matching tasks in the same format as `list-tasks`.

4. **User Interface Improvements**:
   - **Enhance CLI**: Update the command-line interface to:
     - Provide clear prompts for each command.
     - Display meaningful error messages for invalid inputs.
   - **Help Command**: Implement a command (`help`) that lists all available commands and their descriptions.

**Expected Outcomes**:

- An enhanced terminal application that provides users with flexible task management options and improved usability through better prompts and error handling.
