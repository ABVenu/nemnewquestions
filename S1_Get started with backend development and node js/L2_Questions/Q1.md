# Terminal-Based Task Management Application Assignments

## **L2 Assignment: Advanced Features Implementation**

**Objective**: Implement advanced features not covered in the live lecture to enhance the functionality and user experience of the terminal-based task management application.

**Tasks**:

1. **JSON File Storage**:
   - **Implement Data Persistence**: Modify the application to save tasks in a JSON file (`tasks.json`).
   - **Load on Startup**: Ensure that tasks are loaded from the JSON file when the application starts.
   - **Save on Modification**: Automatically save tasks to the JSON file whenever they are added, updated, or deleted.

2. **Data Validation**:
   - **Implement Input Checks**: For all commands that accept user input, ensure that:
     - Task titles are not empty.
     - Due dates follow a valid format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).
   - **Error Feedback**: Provide clear feedback when input is invalid.

3. **Advanced Error Handling**:
   - **Implement Error Management**: Develop logic to handle unexpected inputs gracefully.
   - **Output**: Display informative error messages without crashing the application (e.g., "Task ID not found").

4. **User Configuration Options**:
   - **Implement Preferences**: Allow users to set preferences for task display (e.g., filter options for showing only completed or pending tasks).
   - **Input Requirement**: Create a command (`set-preference`) that accepts user preferences and updates the task display accordingly.
   - **Output**: Confirm that preferences have been updated successfully.

**Expected Outcomes**:

- A robust terminal application that retains user data, validates inputs, handles errors effectively, and allows for a customizable user experience.
