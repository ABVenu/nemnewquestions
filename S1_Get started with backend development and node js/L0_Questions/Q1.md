# Terminal-Based Calculator Application Assignment

## **L0 Assignment: Basic Calculator Implementation**

**Objective**: Implement a basic terminal-based calculator application using command-line arguments.

**Tasks**:

1. **Basic Arithmetic Operations**:  
   - **Implement Commands**: Create commands that allow users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
   - **Command Format**: The application should accept a command in the format:  
     `node calculator.js <operation> <number1> <number2>`  
     Example: `node calculator.js sum 3 5`  
     Supported operations:  
     - `sum`: Adds two numbers  
     - `subtract`: Subtracts the second number from the first  
     - `multiply`: Multiplies two numbers  
     - `divide`: Divides the first number by the second

2. **Validation**:  
   - Ensure valid input by checking:  
     - The command includes the operation and two numbers.  
     - The numbers are valid integers or decimals.  
     - The operation is one of the supported types.  
     - Prevent division by zero.  
   - Display error messages for invalid inputs.

3. **Output**:  
   - Display the result of the calculation in the format:  
     `Result: <calculation result>`  

4. **User-Friendly Feedback**:  
   - If invalid input is provided, display a usage guide showing the correct format and available operations.

**Expected Outcomes**:

- A functional terminal-based calculator that accepts operations via command-line arguments and displays the correct result or appropriate error messages.
