# System Information Application Assignment

## **L0 Assignment: OS and System Info Utility**

**Objective**: Create a terminal-based system information utility using Node.js that displays important OS-related information when executed.

**Tasks**:

1. **Basic System Information**:  
   - **Command**: When running `node systemInfo.js`, the application should print detailed system information, including:
     - Total System Memory
     - Free System Memory
     - Used Memory (calculated as Total Memory - Free Memory)
     - OS Type (e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS)
     - OS Release (e.g., version number)
     - CPU Architecture (e.g., x64 or arm)
     - Number of CPU Cores
     - Uptime (System uptime in hours and minutes)
     - Hostname

2. **Formatting**:  
   - Display the results in a readable format. For example:  
     ```text
     System Information:
     --------------------
     Total Memory: 16 GB
     Free Memory: 4 GB
     Used Memory: 12 GB
     OS Type: Linux
     OS Release: 5.15.0-25
     CPU Architecture: x64
     Number of CPU Cores: 4
     Uptime: 10 hours and 30 minutes
     Hostname: MyComputer
     ```

3. **Functions**:
   - Create separate functions for each of the above data points (e.g., `getFreeMemory()`, `getTotalMemory()`, `getCPUInfo()`, etc.).
   - Use Node.js's built-in `os` module to retrieve all system information.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Ensure memory is displayed in GB (rounded to 2 decimal places).
   - Handle errors gracefully if any system information is unavailable.

**Expected Outcomes**:

- A working terminal-based application that prints all relevant system information in a user-friendly format when `node systemInfo.js` is executed.
