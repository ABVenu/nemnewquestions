# **To-Do List using MongoDB Database**

---

**Total Objective**: Create a MongoDB database for a simple To-Do List application with CRUD operations. This assignment will help practice working with a single collection, performing data insertion, retrieval, updating, and deletion.

## **L0: Basic MongoDB Setup and Collection Setup**

1. **Setup MongoDB and Collection**:  
   - Initialize a MongoDB database named `ToDoList_DB`.  
   - Create a single collection named **`tasks`** for managing tasks.

2. **Insert Sample Data**:  
   - Manually add at least 5 tasks with the following properties:
     - `task_id`: Unique identifier for each task.
     - `task_name`: Name of the task.
     - `description`: Brief description of the task.
     - `status`: Status of the task (`pending`, `in-progress`, or `completed`).
     - `due_date`: Due date for the task.

3. **Basic Read Operations**:  
   - Retrieve all tasks.  
   - Retrieve tasks based on their status (e.g., fetch only `pending` tasks).  
   - Retrieve tasks that have a due date in the next 7 days.  

### **Submission Instructions**  
Please test the queries in the Mongo Shell/Compass & submit the queries in the **queries.txt** file in Masai Repo.
