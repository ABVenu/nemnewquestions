# **L2: Advanced Library Management System**  

---  

**Objective**: Extend the Library Management System with advanced book management and complex business logic using Mongoose. This assignment will help you practice operations such as flattening nested arrays, advanced filtering with `$in`, `$elemMatch`, and array manipulation using `flatMap` to build more challenging queries.

## **L2: Advanced Book Management and Querying**  

1. **Flatten Book Records Across All Libraries**:  
   - Add a new route (`/get-all-books`) that retrieves all books across all libraries as a flat list using `flatMap`.  
   - Ensure the response includes each book’s title, author, genre, and the name of the library it belongs to.  

2. **Route 1: Add Genres to Existing Books**:  
   - Create a PUT route (`/add-genre/:libraryId/:bookTitle`) to add additional genres to a specific book.  
   - Ensure that the new genre is added only if it’s not already present.  

3. **Route 2: Get Libraries by Multiple Genres**:  
   - Create a GET route (`/get-libraries-by-genres?genres=Fiction,Fantasy`) to retrieve all libraries that have books in any of the specified genres.

4. **Route 3: Get Books Matching Multiple Conditions**:  
   - Create a GET route (`/get-books-by-criteria`) that accepts query parameters to filter books based on multiple conditions:  
     - `author`: Exact match  
     - `minPublicationYear`: Minimum publication year (e.g., `minPublicationYear=2000`)  
     - `genres`: Filter by multiple genres (e.g., `genres=Science,History`)  

5. **Route 4: Remove a Book from a Library**:  
   - Create a DELETE route (`/remove-book/:libraryId/:bookTitle`) to remove a specific book from a library.  
   - Ensure that the book is removed only if it exists, and return an appropriate error message if it doesn’t.

## **Instructions**:  

1. Ensure proper responses for all routes, including success messages and meaningful error messages.  
2. Handle errors gracefully using appropriate status codes and error-handling middleware.  
3. Segregate files and folders properly (e.g., `models/`, `routes/`, `controllers/`, `middleware/`, `config/`).  
4. Submit the assignment by pushing it to your Masai Repo and sharing the link.
