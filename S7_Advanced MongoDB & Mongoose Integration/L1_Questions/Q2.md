# **L1: Library Management System with Nested Book Records**

---

**Objective**: Create a Library Management System with a nested Book schema using Mongoose. Implement validations on schema fields and add routes for creating libraries, adding books to libraries, and retrieving libraries with advanced filtering. This assignment will help you understand working with nested documents and Mongoose’s advanced query features.

## **L0: Library Schema and Book Management**  

1. **Library Schema with Nested Book Records**:  

   - Define a `Library` schema with the following fields:  
     - `libraryName`: String, required  
     - `location`: String, required  
     - `establishedYear`: Number, required, must be less than or equal to the current year  
     - `books`: Array of nested schema objects  

   - The nested `Book` schema should contain:  
     - `title`: String, required  
     - `author`: String, required  
     - `genre`: Enum with values `["Fiction", "Non-Fiction", "Science", "History", "Fantasy"]`, required  
     - `publicationYear`: Number, must be greater than 1900  
   - Ensure appropriate schema-level validations for all fields.  

2. **Route 1: Add Library**:  

   - Create a POST route (`/add-library`) to add a new library with basic details (libraryName, location, and establishedYear).  

3. **Route 2: Add Books to an Existing Library**:  

   - Create a POST route (`/add-books/:libraryId`) to add one or more books to a library.  
   - Validate that all book fields are provided and meet the specified constraints.  

4. **Route 3: Get Libraries by Book Genre**:  

   - Create a GET route (`/get-libraries-by-genre/:genre`) to retrieve libraries that have books of a specific genre.  

5. **Route 4: Get Libraries Established Before a Certain Year**:  

   - Create a GET route (`/get-libraries-by-year?before=2000`) to retrieve libraries established before a specified year using Mongoose’s `$lt` operator.  

6. **Route 5: Get Libraries with Books Published After a Certain Year**:  

   - Create a GET route (`/get-libraries-by-book-year?after=2010`) to retrieve libraries that have books published after a specified year using Mongoose’s `$gte` operator.

## **Instructions**:  

1. Ensure proper responses for all routes, including success messages and meaningful error messages.  
2. Handle errors gracefully using appropriate status codes and error-handling middleware.  
3. Segregate files and folders properly (e.g., `models/`, `routes/`, `controllers/`, `middleware/`, `config/`).  
4. Submit the assignment by pushing it to your Masai Repo and sharing the link.
