# **L0: Event Management System**

---

**Objective**: Create an Event Management System using Mongoose with a well-structured schema and comprehensive CRUD operations. Implement advanced query options like sorting, filtering, limiting, and pagination to manage events effectively.

---

## **Schema Design**:

### **Event Schema**:

- `eventName`: String, required, minimum length of 3 characters
- `description`: String, optional
- `eventDate`: Date, required, must be a future date
- `location`: String, required
- `status`: Enum, required, with allowed values `["upcoming", "ongoing", "completed"]`
- `capacity`: Number, required, must be greater than 0
- `createdAt`: Date, default to the current date
- `updatedAt`: Date, automatically updated on modification

---

## **Routes**:

1. **Add Event** (`POST /add-event`):

   - Create a new event with all required fields and validations.

2. **Update Event** (`PUT /update-event/:eventId`):

   - Update event details, including `eventName`, `description`, `eventDate`, `location`, or `status`.
   - Ensure `updatedAt` is automatically updated.

3. **Delete Event** (`DELETE /delete-event/:eventId`):

   - Remove the event by its `eventId`.

4. **Get Events with Capacity Greater than 50** (`GET /events/capacity-greater-50`):

   - Retrieve events where the `capacity` is greater than 50.

5. **Get Events with Capacity Less than 30** (`GET /events/capacity-less-30`):

   - Retrieve events where the `capacity` is less than 30.

6. **Get Events with Pagination** (`GET /events/paginated?limit=5&skip=10`):

   - Retrieve events with limit and skip for pagination purposes.

## **Instructions**:

1. Ensure proper responses for all routes, including success messages and meaningful error messages.
2. Handle errors gracefully using appropriate status codes and error-handling middleware.
3. Segregate files and folders properly (e.g., `models/`, `routes/`, `controllers/`, `middleware/`, `config/`).
4. Submit the assignment by pushing it to your Masai Repo and sharing the link.
