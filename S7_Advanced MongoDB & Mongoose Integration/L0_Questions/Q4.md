# **L0: Doctor Management System with CRUD Operations and Advanced Querying**

---

**Objective**: Create a Doctor Management System using Mongoose with a single Doctor schema. Perform CRUD operations and implement advanced query options like filtering doctors by age, experience, and specialization.

---

## **Schema Design**:

### **Doctor Schema**:
- `name`: String, required, minimum length of 3 characters  
- `age`: Number, required, must be greater than 25  
- `location`: String, required  
- `gender`: String, required, enum of `["male", "female", "other"]`  
- `experience`: Number, required, must be greater than or equal to 0  
- `specializations`: Array of strings, required (e.g., `["General Physician", "Cardiologist", "Dermatologist"]`)  
- `createdAt`: Date, default to the current date  
- `updatedAt`: Date, automatically updated on modification  

---

## **Routes**:

1. **Add Doctor** (`POST /add-doctor`):  
   - Create a new doctor entry with all required fields and validations.  

2. **Update Doctor** (`PUT /update-doctor/:doctorId`):  
   - Update doctor details such as `name`, `location`, `specializations`, or `experience`.  

3. **Delete Doctor** (`DELETE /delete-doctor/:doctorId`):  
   - Remove a doctor by their `doctorId`.  

4. **Get Doctors by Specialization** (`GET /doctors/specialization/:specialization`):  
   - Retrieve all doctors for a specific specialization.  

5. **Get Doctors by Age** (`GET /doctors/age?gte=30&lte=50`):  
   - Retrieve all doctors with an age greater than or equal to 30 and less than or equal to 50.  

6. **Get Doctors by Experience** (`GET /doctors/experience?gte=5`):  
   - Retrieve all doctors with at least 5 years of experience.  

7. **Get All Doctors with Pagination** (`GET /doctors/paginated?limit=5&skip=10`):  
   - Retrieve doctors with pagination using `limit` and `skip`.

## **Instructions**:

1. Provide appropriate responses for all routes, including success and error messages.  
2. Handle errors gracefully using appropriate status codes and middleware.  
3. Segregate files and folders properly (e.g., `models/`, `routes/`, `controllers/`).  
4. Submit the assignment by pushing it to your Masai Repo and sharing the link.
