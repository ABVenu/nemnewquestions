# **L0: Recipe Management System**

---

**Objective**: Create a Recipe Management System using Mongoose with well-structured schema validations and CRUD operations. Implement advanced query options like filtering, sorting, and pagination for recipe management.

---

## **Schema Design**:

### **Recipe Schema**:

- `recipeName`: String, required, minimum length of 3 characters
- `ingredients`: Array of strings, required (e.g., `["flour", "sugar", "butter"]`)
- `cuisine`: String, required, enum of `["Indian", "Chinese", "Italian", "Mexican", "American"]`
- `prepTime`: Number (in minutes), required, must be greater than 0
- `cookTime`: Number (in minutes), required, must be greater than 0
- `servings`: Number, required, must be greater than 0
- `difficulty`: Enum, required, with allowed values `["easy", "medium", "hard"]`
- `createdAt`: Date, default to the current date
- `updatedAt`: Date, automatically updated on modification

---

## **Routes**:

1. **Add Recipe** (`POST /add-recipe`):

   - Create a new recipe with all required fields and validations.

2. **Update Recipe** (`PUT /update-recipe/:recipeId`):

   - Update recipe details such as `recipeName`, `ingredients`, `cuisine`, or `difficulty`.

3. **Delete Recipe** (`DELETE /delete-recipe/:recipeId`):

   - Remove a recipe by its `recipeId`.

4. **Get Recipes by Cuisine** (`GET /recipes/cuisine/:cuisineType`):

   - Retrieve all recipes for a specific cuisine.

5. **Get Recipes with Prep Time Under 30 Minutes** (`GET /recipes/prep-time-under-30`):

   - Retrieve recipes with a `prepTime` of less than 30 minutes.

6. **Get Recipes with Pagination** (`GET /recipes/paginated?limit=5&skip=10`):

   - Retrieve recipes with limit and skip for pagination purposes.

7. **Get Recipes by Difficulty** (`GET /recipes/difficulty/:difficulty`):
   - Filter recipes by their difficulty level (`easy`, `medium`, or `hard`).

## **Instructions**:

1. Ensure proper responses for all routes, including success messages and meaningful error messages.
2. Handle errors gracefully using appropriate status codes and error-handling middleware.
3. Segregate files and folders properly (e.g., `models/`, `routes/`, `controllers/`, `middleware/`).
4. Submit the assignment by pushing it to your Masai Repo and sharing the link.
